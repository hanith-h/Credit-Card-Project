# üí≥ CREDIT CARD PROJECT ‚Äì PHASE 1  

---

## üìñ OVERVIEW  
This project focuses on **CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION** using **MACHINE LEARNING** techniques. The dataset contains anonymized credit card transaction data, where the task is to identify fraudulent transactions.  

The project addresses the challenge of **IMBALANCED DATA**, since fraudulent cases are significantly fewer compared to non-fraudulent ones.

## üìä DATASET INFORMATION  
- **DESCRIPTION**: Transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.  
- **SIZE**: 284,807 transactions  
- **CLASSES**:  
  - `0` ‚Üí LEGITIMATE TRANSACTION  
  - `1` ‚Üí FRAUDULENT TRANSACTION  
- **FEATURES**:  
  - Most features are anonymized (`V1`, `V2`, ‚Ä¶, `V28`).  
  - `Time` and `Amount` are original features.  
  - `Class` is the target label.

## üöÄ HOW TO RUN LOCALLY  
1. **CLONE THE REPOSITORY**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CREDIT-CARD-PROJECT.git
   cd CREDIT-CARD-PROJECT
   ```  

2. **INSTALL DEPENDENCIES**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  

3. **RUN NOTEBOOK**  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Credit Card Project-Phase1.ipynb"
   ```

## üìà RESULTS SUMMARY  
- **IMBALANCED DATA** was successfully handled using **SMOTE / RESAMPLING TECHNIQUES**.  
- MACHINE LEARNING MODELS were trained and evaluated, with **ENSEMBLE METHODS** (Random Forest / Gradient Boosting) performing better than simple Logistic Regression.  
- **ROC-AUC SCORES** and **RECALL** were prioritized, since identifying fraud correctly is more critical than minimizing false positives.
